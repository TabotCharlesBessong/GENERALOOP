# OOPWITHJAVA-C-
This repository has for main purpose to be my notes for the OOP course for the the fourth semester in my school 
It is only for JAVA AND CPP

However , other OOP languages can be integrated into it as well 

But anyone who wanna work with me on java and cpp could join cuz i intend to add more than just OOP concepts
